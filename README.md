# SRAssembler
Selective and Recursive local Assembler

The __SRAssembler__ repository is the distribution point of our code for selective
local assembly of genomic regions matching a homologous query protein or DNA sequence.
This code will be useful to you if you have a (large) set of genomic reads for some
organism and want to find out whether that set of reads represents deep enough
sequencing to assemble genomic regions containing or encoding a homolog to a known
gene or protein you are providing as query (and you want to answer this question
quickly, without assembling the whole genome!).


## Getting Started

The __SRAssembler__ package conforms to our [RAMOSE](https://github.com/BrendelGroup/)
philosophy and promise: we made every attempt to make the software such that
you can produce __reproducible__, __accurate__, and __meaningful__ results; our
software is __open__ (source), designed to be __scalable__, and __easy__ to use
(so that a typical genome laboratory should be able to run it).  And, of course,
our software should be _ramose_ ("having many branches") - it's yours to use,
modify, improve, enhance, ... .

To proceed, please follow the instructions in the [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md)
document.  Once all preparatory steps are taken care of, see the
[HOWTO](./HOWTO.md) document
