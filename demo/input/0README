We used SAMTools' wgsim program to simulate 2 libraries from region 300,000 ~ 400,000 of chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis with insert size 200bp and 1kb. Each library has 50,000 paired reads. The base error rate is 0.002 and the fraction of indels is 0.001.
AT1G01950.cdna is the transcript sequence for At1g01950.1 from Araport11.
LOC_Os06g04560.pep is the protein sequence for LOC_Os06g04560.1 from MSU Osa1 Release 7.
